        lyrics: "You can view the world in an unusual way\n
            The path you take may lead you astray\n
            Not to worry\n
            They may criticize the choices you make\n
            Reminding you that your future’s at stake\n
            Not to worry\n\n

            Take me away, far away to where the clouds take time off\n
            Take me away, far away\n
            To a place where I belong\n

            Been standing in line for most of my time\n
            Trying to buy what’s already mine\n
            Got to hurry\n
            Emotions take hold like a dog on a bone\n
            Push them aside while you do as you’re told\n
            Not to worry\n

            Take me away, far away to where the clouds take time off\n
            Take me away, far away\n
            To a place where I belong\n

            Take me away, far away to where the clouds take time off\n
            Take me away, far away\n
            To a place where I belong\n"
