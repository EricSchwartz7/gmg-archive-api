        title: "Take Me Away",
        lyrics: "You can view the world in an unusual way
            The path you take may lead you astray
            Not to worry
            They may criticize the choices you make
            Reminding you that your future’s at stake
            Not to worry

            Take me away, far away to where the clouds take time off
            Take me away, far away
            To a place where I belong

            Been standing in line for most of my time
            Trying to buy what’s already mine
            Got to hurry
            Emotions take hold like a dog on a bone
            Push them aside while you do as you’re told
            Not to worry

            Take me away, far away to where the clouds take time off
            Take me away, far away
            To a place where I belong

            Take me away, far away to where the clouds take time off
            Take me away, far away
            To a place where I belong"

        title: "I Hope You Know",
        lyrics: "Woke up on a Monday morning
        Running late as I always do
        But the coffee ain’t in the pot
        So awake I will be not
        
        Hey man you really got me down
        Should have told me not to make a sound
        Had I known you would react this way
        Would have saved it for another day
        
        But this is my love
        I won’t let go
        I’m feeling so good
        I hope you know
        
        Autopilot becomes engaged
        On a treadmill inside a cage
        And as I struggle to pass the time
        Only one thing is on my mind
        
        But this is my love
        I won’t let go
        I’m feeling so good
        I hope you know
        
        If you could only see me now
        If you could only see me now
        
        If you could only see me now
        (She’s standing right outside my window)
        If you could only see me now
        (I hear her knocking at my door)

        But this is my love
        I won’t let go
        I’m feeling so good
        I hope you know
        I hope you know
        I hope you know
        I hope you know"
